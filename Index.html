        <h3> Why Computer Engieering?</h3>
        <p>When going into college I was very unsure of what major to go into, the only thing that I found interest in when I was in high school was computers </p>
        <p>and video games. So I decided to apply for Computer Engieering and luckily I got accepted. I told myself that if I found another interest while in </p>
        <p>college I would be able to swap over majority of my engineering credits to another major so no harm no faul. Insead of finding another major, I began </p>
        <p>to really enjoy and diving deeper into computer engineering and what is about. During my sophomore year summer I had an internship at <a href="https://www.marathonpetroleum.com/">Marathon Petroleum Company</a>,</p>
        <p>here is where I found my passion for computer engineering. While at my internship I had my first real world experience with engineering and I absolutely </p>
        <p>fell in love with it. Ever since then I have been thriving and growing as a computer engineering student and hope to continue this journey for years to come.</p>
